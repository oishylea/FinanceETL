## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

This project includes two Airflow DAGs:

### 1. `finance_etl_pipeline_ppf`
- Filters the dataset based on the **Public Provident Fund (PPF)** column.
- Saves each PPF preference group into separate CSV files.

### 2. `finance_etl_pipeline_gender`
- Filters the dataset based on **gender**.
- Saves each gender group into separate CSV files.

Each DAG performs:

- **Extract**: Reads the original CSV file.
- **Transform**: Filters based on column values.
- **Load**: Saves the output to separate CSV files in `transformed_data/` and `transformed_data_gender/`.
